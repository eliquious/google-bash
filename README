WHAT IS THIS??

This is a Windows cmd-line interface for Chrome, Google's web browser. 

A linux version is on the way shortly.

This allows you to pull up Chrome with your search results from your cmd line. This little tool can also navigate to certain urls (-url), Google Maps (-maps), Google Mail (-mail), Google's Developer page (-dev), and also Google Code (-code).

You can search for single words or phrases very easily. Searching a phrase? Just add quotes around it, if not the quotes aren't needed at all.

Want to browse your C:\ Drive? Just type 'google -cdrive' in your cmd prompt.


HOW DO I INSTALL??

1. Download with git or from github
2. Find google.bat (you just downloaded it) and add it's location to your PATH.
3. Find chrome.exe and add the directory to your PATH.
4. Open a new Command Prompt and type 'google'.
5. You're done. Enjoy your new shiny tool.

If you do not know how to set your PATH variable in Windows, just search Google for 'setting windows path'.
NOTE: You may have to open a new command prompt in Windows before it can be used.
